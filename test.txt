Forget you and your mom and your sister and your job
And your broke down car and the things you call art
Forget you and your friends that I'll never see again
Everybody but your dog, you can all get lost
I swear I meant to mean the best when it ended
Even tried to bite my tongue when you start, hmm
Now you're texting all my friends asking questions
They never even liked you in the first place
Dated a girl that I hate for the attention
She only made it two days, what a connection
It's like you do anything for my affection
You're going all about it in the worst ways
